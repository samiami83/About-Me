    <h2>About me:</h2>

    <p>Born here on Earth a little over 3 decades ago, I enjoyed a generally average childhood and adolescence. A couple of years after high-school I joined the Navy, where I was trained in electronic maintenance and repair. Shortly after separating from the military I attended university and upon completion received a BS in audio engineering and recording. Having decided by this point that I had no interest in pursuing a career in the music industry I fell back on my previous training and sought work as an electronics technician. As a technician I was employed at a consumer electronics manufacturer, an avionics company, a semiconductor fab, and at a metrology company (in that order). Now i'm attending Code Fellows in the hopes of becoming a superstar software developer and finding employment in the tech industry.</p>
